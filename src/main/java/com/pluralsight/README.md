This README summarizes key Java concepts and syntax used in object-oriented programming (OOP).  
Each section includes definitions, explanations, and code examples i have used and incorporated into my code.
for Loop

Used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.

switch, case, and break

switch allows branching logic based on variable values.
case defines each branch, and break prevents fall-through.

Constructors

A constructor is a special method used to initialize new objects.
It has the same name as the class and no return type.

this Keyword

Refers to the current instance of the class. Useful for distinguishing instance variables from parameters.

Parameters

Variables passed into methods or constructors that act as inputs.

implements

Used when a class adopts an interface. Forces the class to define all methods declared in the interface.

StringBuilder and append()

StringBuilder is used for mutable strings, allowing efficient modification.
append() adds text to the end.

get Methods (Getters)

Used to retrieve the value of private variables. Part of encapsulation.

is Convention

Boolean methods often start with is to indicate a true/false state.
